A single page application providing a responsive web user interface for the SKOOP server application.

== INCUBATION WARNING

*This project is in the incubation stage and is by far NOT ready for production use!*

== Getting started

=== Introduction

SKOOP WebApp is a single page application which provides a responsive web user interface for the SKOOP Server. It makes use of the REST API provided by the server to interact with the various SKOOP functionalities like relating users to skills, viewing statistics and many more.

=== System requirements

For hosting the pre-built distribution:

* Web server of your choice (e.g. Nginx, Apache HTTP Server)

For running the application as a Docker container:

* Docker 18.06 (or higher)
* _Optional:_ Docker Compose

For development:

* Node.js 10.5.x (or higher)
* NPM 6.2.x (or higher)

=== Building the application from source

The project uses https://www.npmjs.com/[NPM] in conjunction with https://github.com/angular/angular-cli[Angular CLI] to build the final static assets of the application. Run the following commands in the project root to build the application:

    npm install
    npm run build

This installs the dependencies and then compiles the final static assets in the `dist/myskills-webapp` directory. These files can be served by an arbitrary web server.

=== Hosting the compiled distribution

The static assets of the application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) can be hosted by any web server.

_Important configurations:_

The web server must provide the `index.html` file for every route of the application. For example, if a user requests the deeplink `/skills/123/users` the main page must be served for this request as well. The Angular router will show the appropriate component once the application has been initialized.

See the following documentation for example configurations: https://angular.io/guide/deployment#server-configuration

Additionally, the web server must forward every request starting with `/api/` to the SKOOP Server application. For example, the SKOOP WebApp will request the user identity by calling `/api/my-identity`. The web server receiving this request must strip off the leading `/api` and forward the request for `/my-identity` to the SKOOP Server.

=== Running as Docker container

We do not provide any public Docker images at the moment. But you can create your own after building the application from source.

After completing the NPM build run the following command in the project root (mind the dot at the end):

----
docker build \
  -t myskills/webapp:latest \
  .
----

Then you can start the container as usual:

----
docker run \
  --name myskills-webapp \
  -d \
  -p 4200:80 \
  --link myskills-server \
  -e SERVER_NAME=localhost:4200 \
  -e SERVER_ADMIN=your-name@your-domain.com
  -e MYSKILLS_SERVER_URL=http://myskills-server:8080 \
  -e MYSKILLS_WEBAPP_AUTHENTICATION_ISSUER=http://localhost:9000/auth/realms/MySkills \
  -e MYSKILLS_WEBAPP_AUTHENTICATION_INSECURE=true \
  myskills/webapp:latest
----

Now the SKOOP WebApp is accessible at http://localhost:4200/

_Note: This command example assumes that you have created a container for the SKOOP Server named "myskills-server" and that a KeyCloak server with a "MySkills" realm is running on `localhost:9000`._

=== Technology overview

As described in the introduction the SKOOP WebApp is a browser-based single page application which provides a web user interface to interact with the SKOOP Server. Therefore, it focuses on the presentation of the data retrieved from the REST API endpoints of the server. The project makes use of the following noteworthy frameworks:

* https://angular.io/[Angular]: The popular JavaScript framework is the basis of the application. We use the Angular routing for navigation to different views.
* https://github.com/angular/angular-cli[Angular CLI]: Makes development and the build process of the application much easier. It encapsulates the Webpack build configuration and provides some reasonable conventions to follow instead. The CLI also provides some convenient commands to generate new components, services, etc.
* https://material.angular.io/[Angular Material]: Provides components to build an application with Google's Material design. We use it as a basis for our graphical layout.
* https://github.com/angular/flex-layout[Angular Flex-Layout]: Provides directives to create responsive layouts with Angular based on Flexbox CSS. We use it to make the application look great on handsets and desktops.
* https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc[Angular OAuth2 OIDC]: Enables support for user authentication via OpenID Connect using an external authorization server.
* https://sass-lang.com/[SASS]: Stylesheet pre-processor used for component style definitions.
* https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/[RxJS]: When it comes to asynchronous operations the reactive extensions with their well-known `Observables` come into play. We use them primarily when requesting the API of the SKOOP Server.
* https://karma-runner.github.io/[Karma] and https://jasmine.github.io/[Jasmine]: The standard tools for test automation in Angular projects.

=== Installing the dependencies

Before starting with development you have to download the project dependencies using NPM. Run the following command in the project root:

    npm install

The installation takes some time... be patient ðŸ˜´

=== Running the development server

Once the dependencies have been installed you can launch the Webpack development server by running this command:

    npm start

As soon as the server is running open this URL in your browser: http://localhost:4200/

Webpack automatically reloads modules when you change the source code. There is no need to restart the server after each modification.

The server proxies all requests starting with the path `/api/` to http://localhost:8080/ (stripping that prefix). For example, a request to `/api/skills` will be forwarded to `http://localhost:8080/skills`. This allows the development server to collaborate with the real SKOOP Server application.

=== Configuring authentication

In order to set up the OpenID Connect login you need to install a local https://www.keycloak.org/[KeyCloak] server and configure an appropriate realm.

In the development configuration the SKOOP WebApp assumes that the KeyCloak server is available at `localhost:9000`. Currently, there is no option for external configuration. If you have to use a different host or port please temporarily adjust the configuration in `src/environments/environment.ts`.

There must be a realm called `MySkills` which allows the client `myskills` to perform the OpenID Connect implicit flow.

Please see the https://github.com/KnowledgeAssets/myskills-server[MySkills Server] for more hints and a preconfigured KeyCloak test realm.

=== Testing the application

The automated tests can be executed by running the following command in the project root:

    npm test

_Note: The Karma configuration relies on Chrome as the browser to run the tests._

Travis CI uploads test coverage reports to https://codecov.io[codecov.io]. Uploaded reports can be found https://codecov.io/gh/KnowledgeAssets/myskills-webapp[here].

=== Architecture overview

Fundamentally, the SKOOP WebApp project follows the principles of https://angular.io/[Angular] projects. The directory structure and naming follows the conventions given by the https://github.com/angular/angular-cli[Angular CLI] tool and the https://angular.io/guide/styleguide[Angular style guide].

==== Source code structure

In the application source directory `src/app` there are various subdirectories focusing on specific parts of the domain model. For example, the directory `src/app/my-skills` contains everything related to the presentation of the user's personal skill profile page (components, services, tests). The `src/app/shared` directory contains cross-cutting sources which are used all across the application.

==== Routing

The routing to different views is accomplished by the Angular router. The configuration is encapsulated in its own module `src/app/app-routing.module.ts`.

==== Material components

The import of all Angular Material components is also centralized in the module `src/app/app-material.module.ts`. This module can also be imported in test specs to have the Material components ready to go.

==== Authentication and authorization

The application makes use of the https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc[Angular OAuth2 OIDC] module to authenticates users against an external OpenID Connect provider (e.g. KeyCloak) using the implicit flow. The obtained ID tokens are automatically added to any API requests sent to the SKOOP Server using an auto-configured `HttpInterceptor`.

==== Styling

The directory `src/styles` is configured as a Sass include path. All files from this directory can be imported directly without traversal. For example, the variables module `src/styles/_variables.scss` can be imported in any other Sass source file using `@import 'variables';`.

==== Environment configuration

Environment-specific configuration is located in the module `src/environments/environment.ts` (Angular CLI convention). This module contains the development configuration. During the production build this module is replaced by the production version `environment.prod.ts`. The main HTML page `src/index.html` is handled in a similar way. During the production build it is replaced by `src/index.prod.html`.

The concept for external environment configuration assumes that environment-specific settings are given as `meta` elements in the main HTML page. Therefore, the production `environment` module looks for external configuration in such specific `meta` elements in the document.

The main HTML page for production contains the supported `meta` elements with server-side-include tags inside their `content` attributes. This allows the Apache HTTP Server hosting the SKOOP WebApp to resolve these placeholders to configuration values given as external environment variables.

==== Code guidelines

There are some general design principles to follow in the project.

Components should never make use of the `HttpClient` directly. Calling the API of the SKOOP Server is the responsibility of services. These services should return the `Observable` of the HTTP response directly to their calling code without subscribing on their own (except there is some reason to do so).

Reusable styles should be written as Sass mixins in the file `src/styles/_mixins.scss`. Common values for sizes and colors should be written as variables in the file `src/styles/_variables.scss` and then the variable should be used for the specific style property.
